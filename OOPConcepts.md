Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). Here are some fundamental concepts related to OOP:

1. Class and Object:

Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that the objects of the class will have.
Object: An instance of a class. It is a concrete entity created based on the blueprint provided by the class.

2. Encapsulation:

The bundling of data (attributes) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to some of the object's components and can prevent unintended interference.

3. Inheritance:

A mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.

4. Polymorphism:

The ability of a single function, method, or operator to work in different ways based on the context. In OOP, polymorphism often involves method overriding (redefining a method in a subclass) and method overloading (defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters).

5. Abstraction:

Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they possess, while ignoring irrelevant details. Abstraction allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.
Association:

A relationship between two or more classes. It describes how objects from different classes are connected and interact with each other.
Constructor and Destructor:

Constructor: A special method called when an object is created. It initializes the object's attributes and sets it up for use.
Destructor: A special method called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used for cleanup operations before the object is removed from memory.
Method Overriding and Overloading:

Method Overriding: Providing a specific implementation of a method in a subclass that is already defined in its superclass.
Method Overloading: Defining multiple methods with the same name in the same class but with different parameter types or numbers.
Interface:

A collection of abstract methods that a class can implement. It defines a contract that classes must adhere to, ensuring a consistent set of methods across multiple classes.
Association, Aggregation, and Composition:

Association: A relationship between two classes where one class is related to another class, but neither is part of the other.
Aggregation: A form of association where one class contains another class as a part, but the contained class can exist independently.
Composition: A stronger form of aggregation where one class is composed of another class, and the contained class has no independent existence.
