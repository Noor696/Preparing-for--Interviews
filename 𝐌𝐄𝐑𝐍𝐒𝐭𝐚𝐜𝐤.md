‚úçÔ∏èMERN stands for **MongoDB, Express, React, Node**, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

üìå**MongoDB** ‚Äî document database.

üìå**Express(.js)** ‚Äî Node.js web framework - Used to build the backend.

üìå**React(.js)** ‚Äî a client-side JavaScript framework - Used to build the frontend.

üìå**Node(.js)** ‚Äî the premier JavaScript web server - Used to build the backend.

**All these technologies are built on JavaScript.**


**What is Full Stack?**

Fullstack Development is a type of software
development that involves working on both the
backend (server) and the frontend (client).

**How you can become Full stack developer?**

* There are various ways to become a fullstack
developer. There are many technologies that you
can work with to become a fullstack developer.

* a path that involves starting
with HTML, CSS, JS and then learning the MERN
stack.

### HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Fetching data from APIs
- Controlled & Uncontrolled Components
- Routing in React
- Context API & React hooks

### Node and Express 

* Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application
framework that provides a robust set of features for web
and mobile applications.

* Most big companies use Java or Java-like languages for
the backend. Most startups use Python or Node+Express for
the backend.

* Express helps build the backend very easily while staying in
JavaScript ecosystem. It is preferred for self-projects as it
helps focus on learning development and building projects
pretty fast.

### MongoDB

* MongoDB is a non-relational document database that
provides support for JSON-like storage. The MongoDB
database has a flexible data model that enables you to
store unstructured data, and it provides full indexing
support, and replication with rich and intuitive APIs.

* MongoDB has become popular with developers in part
due to the its intuitive API, flexible data model, and
