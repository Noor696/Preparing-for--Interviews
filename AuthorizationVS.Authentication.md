**What is the difference between Authorization and Authentication?**

* Authorization is the security process that determines a user or service's level of access. In technology, we use authorization to give users or services permission to access some data or perform a particular action.

* Authentication (AuthN) is a process that verifies that someone or something is who they say they are. Technology systems typically use some form of authentication to secure access to an application or its data.
