**1. Is Python a programming language?**

even though scripting can be done in Python, it is thought of as a programming language.

1.1 differences between scripting and programming languages:

- Programming languages: consist of a set of instructions that achieve specific outputs.
- Scripting languages: are programming languages written exclusively for a special run-time.

**2.Could you tell me what are the main features of Python?**

A. Python is an interpreted language. itâ€™s different from C++, which requires the user to compile it before a run.

B. other crucial Python features, there is no requirement to specify particular variables, since Python is classed as a dynamically typed language.

C. functions, which are first-class objects in Python, enable the user to assign them a variable.

**3. Explain what are modules in Python?**

modules are critical in Python and are used frequently, modules in Python are best described as files. 
These files hold code, which, in Python, can take the form of a class or a variable.

**4. How will you improve the performance of a program in Python?**

There are many ways to improve the performance of a Python
program. Some of these are as follows:

**i. Data Structure:** We have to select the right data structure for our purpose in a Python program.

**ii. Standard Library:** Wherever possible, we should use methods from standard library. Methods implemented in
standard library have much better performance than user implementation.

**iii. Abstraction:** At times, a lot of abstraction and
indirection can cause slow performance of a program. We should remove the redundant abstraction in code.

**iv. Algorithm:** Use of right algorithm can make a big difference in a program. We have to find and select the suitable algorithm to solve our problem with high performance.

**5. What are the benefits of using Python?**

Python is strong that even Google uses it. Some of the benefits of using Python are as follows:

**i. Efficient:** Python is very efficient in memory
management. For a large data set like Big Data, it is much easier to program in Python.

**ii. Faster:** Though Python code is interpreted, still Python has very fast performance.

**iii. Wide usage:** Python is widely used among different organizations for different projects. Due to this wide usage, there are thousands of add-ons available for use with Python.

**iv. Easy to learn:** Python is quite easy to learn. This is the biggest benefit of using Python. Complex tasks can be very easily implemented in Python.

**6. How does memory management work in Python?**

* There is a private heap space in Python that contains all the Python objects and data structures. In CPython there is a memory manager responsible for managing the heap space. 
* There are different components in Python memory manager that handle segmentation, sharing, caching, memory pre-allocation etc.
* Python memory manager also takes care of garbage collection by using Reference counting algorithm.
